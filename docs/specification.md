## Branches

## Project standards
When working on issues include the issue number. Pull-requests should be always be created on a new branch with the branch named after the issue. If the issue is (#9 "Do this"), then the branch shall be named "issue/9-do-this". 
Issues should have a short but descriptive title with a longer description describing the issue.

## Project

### Idea
The project aims to create a 2-dimensional physics engine, where you are able to spawn in objects. The objects can be simple shapes, or complex shapes consisting of simple shapes combined with joints. The end goal is too be able to place more advanced objects such as springs and thrusters.

### Feasibillity
Since we are 4 devolopers working on the project and creating a simple 2d program we deem it feasibile to accomplish this.

### Workflow


### Areas of responsibility
| Area | Person |
