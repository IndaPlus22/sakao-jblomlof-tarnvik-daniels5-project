## Branches

## Project standards
When working on issues include the issue number. Pull-requests should be always be created on a new branch with the branch named after the issue. If the issue is (#9 "Do this"), then the branch shall be named "issue/9-do-this". 
Issues should have a short but descriptive title with a longer description describing the issue.

## Project

### Idea
The project aims to create a 2-dimensional physics engine, where you are able to spawn in objects. The objects can be simple shapes, or complex shapes consisting of simple shapes combined with joints.

### Feasibillity
Since we are 4 devolopers working on the project and creating a simple 2d program we deem it feasibile to accomplish this.

### Workflow
